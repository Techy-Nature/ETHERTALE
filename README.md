# ETHERTALE
## "(a) crazy, fun AU that's like a cross between Outertale, Deltarune and a futuristic sci-fi adventure shounen series." -Amee, Author's Friend

# ETHERTALE

A coming of age adventure CYOA UNDERTALE AU that will have space travel, inventory management, sci-fi technology and choices that impact your playthrough as well as future playthroughs, just like the original UNDERTALE.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below in installing. Find index.html and run that on any recently updated browser after extracting the zip file, and you should be ready to play! Make sure to keep the files in the same arrangement and the same file names as they came in.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the images, fonts and music to go with the HTML file. They are all bundled in the releases page. Twine games are generally pretty easy on the computer so all you'll really need is a browser of some sort that can display images and text effects, and you'll be good. Just get the most recent version of whatever browser you'll be using and you should be set.

### Installing

1. Download ETHERTALE.zip from [releases page.](https://github.com/Techy-Nature/ETHERTALE/releases)

2. Extract the folder anywhere you please (just please don't rename the img and font files or move the font and image files outside of their folder structure okay? thanks!)

3. Run index.html in any internet browser

4. Make sure **NOT** to use private mode while playing Twine games. *SAVES* will **NOT** work on that mode. Also don't erase your cache without first backing up your save externally.
